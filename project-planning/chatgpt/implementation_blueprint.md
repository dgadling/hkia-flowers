## **Implementation Blueprint**

### **Step 1: Project Setup**
- Initialize a Swift project.
- Set up SwiftUI or UIKit based on final framework choice.
- Configure necessary dependencies for image processing and OCR (e.g., Vision framework for OCR, CoreML for computer vision).
- Implement a basic UI structure with placeholder views.
- Set up local storage for inventory persistence.

### **Step 2: Screen Broadcast Capture**
- Implement screen broadcast capture using ReplayKit.
- Ensure video frames can be processed in real-time.
- Test and refine frame extraction performance.

### **Step 3: Computer Vision & OCR Processing**
- Implement edge detection and template matching for flower recognition.
- Integrate OCR for text extraction from selected flowers.
- Develop confidence scoring for recognition accuracy.
- Implement fallback options for manual user corrections.

### **Step 4: Inventory Management**
- Implement real-time inventory updates based on screen analysis.
- Store inventory data locally.
- Develop UI for inventory viewing with sorting and filtering.
- Allow manual inventory corrections.

### **Step 5: Breeding Logic & Suggestions**
- Encode predefined breeding rules into an algorithm.
- Implement a prioritization system for breeding combinations.
- Develop a system to detect dependencies (blocked breeding paths).
- Display breeding suggestions in a structured list.

### **Step 6: Visualization & Explanations**
- Implement a flowchart or dependency tracking view.
- Enable users to tap on flowers to view breeding explanations.
- Develop an intuitive UI for visualizing dependencies.

### **Step 7: Progress Tracking & Goals**
- Implement tracking for collected flower types.
- Allow users to set and save breeding goals.
- Ensure progress data persists across sessions.

### **Step 8: Final Refinements & Testing**
- Implement UI/UX refinements.
- Conduct unit testing on OCR, computer vision, and breeding logic.
- Perform integration testing with screen broadcasting.
- Conduct usability testing and gather feedback.
