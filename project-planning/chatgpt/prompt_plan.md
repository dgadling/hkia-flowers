## **Code-Generation Prompts for Implementation**

### **Prompt 1: Project Initialization**
```text
Generate a Swift project with SwiftUI support and set up ReplayKit for screen broadcast capture. Ensure a minimal UI structure with placeholder views for the inventory list and breeding suggestions.
```

### **Prompt 2: Implement Screen Broadcast Capture**
```text
Using ReplayKit, implement a screen broadcast feature that allows capturing and processing video frames in real time. Ensure extracted frames are accessible for further analysis.
```

### **Prompt 3: Implement Computer Vision & OCR**
```text
Develop an image processing module using CoreML and Vision framework that can detect flower images using edge detection and template matching. Additionally, implement an OCR-based text extraction system for selected flowers.
```

### **Prompt 4: Implement Inventory Management**
```text
Develop a local data storage system using CoreData or UserDefaults to persist the user’s flower inventory. Ensure that inventory updates correctly reflect additions, deletions, and modifications from both automated scanning and manual edits.
```

### **Prompt 5: Develop Breeding Logic System**
```text
Implement a rule-based breeding engine that determines possible breeding combinations based on the user’s inventory. Ensure the system prioritizes prerequisite combinations and dynamically updates when new flowers are added.
```

### **Prompt 6: Implement UI for Breeding Suggestions**
```text
Design and develop a UI component that lists prioritized breeding suggestions. Allow users to tap on a flower to view possible ways to create it and track dependencies blocking certain flowers.
```

### **Prompt 7: Implement Flowchart Visualization**
```text
Develop an interactive flowchart UI that visually represents blocked breeding paths. Ensure dependencies are clearly marked and users can trace breeding requirements step-by-step.
```

### **Prompt 8: Final Testing & Optimization**
```text
Conduct thorough unit and integration testing on all major functionalities. Optimize performance of computer vision and OCR processing, ensuring efficient screen capture and data updates.
```
